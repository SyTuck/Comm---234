My name is Jordan Tuck, I am a game design student at St Lawrence College. I would like to discuss with you the benefits and pitfalls of starting and maintaining a small independent game studio.

As a former professional programmer and mature student at the college; I am seeking to create a studio. I would very much welcome the opportunity to talk with you about your adventures on the path to becoming a successful game developer. If you are available within the next few weeks I would like to offer a lunch meeting in exchange for sharing your experience and time.

If there is no time for lunch in your schedule; we can also communicate through email, skype, or phone.
Thank you for your consideration and I wish you all the best in your endeavors.
I look forward to hearing from you
